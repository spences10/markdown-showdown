# Markdown

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>- Let's talk about Markdown</p>
  <p>
    - This talk didn't exist last week and was born out of a talk I
    had with Ro!
  </p>
  <p>
    - I was encouraging Ro to own her content and build her own
    platform for her writing.
  </p>
  <p>- Ro isn't feeling well today, so, get well soon Ro!.</p>
  <p>
    - It was me saying something along the lines of, Gatsby is awesome
    because you can write your content in Markdown and it's useable on
    many platforms
  </p>
  <p>- Ro's response</p>

# Markdown

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - Essentially Markdown is a way to format your text, like you
    would in Microsoft Word but without using the toolbar to select
    the format for the text.
  </p>
  <p>
    - The goal for Markdown is to enable easy to write and easy to
    read plain text format that can be converted to HTML in the
    browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    - You will see Markdown being used in places like GitHub, GitLab,
    Jira
  </p>
  <p>
    - Places like Discord, Slack, StackOverflow, Reddit all use some
    form of Markdown
  </p>
  <p>- You can also use Markdown in WhatsApp, to an extent</p>
  <p>- Whole documentation sites use Markdown</p>
  <p>- These slides are written in Markdown</p>

<SpeakerNotes>
  <p>
    - This way of adding links can become a bit disorienting if there
    are many links in a document making it hard to read
  </p>
  <p>
    - And the whole point of Markdown is to make the text easier to
    read.
  </p>
  <p>- The approach I like to take is using keys or references:</p>
</SpeakerNotes>

## This isn't great to read
